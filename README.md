If you want to install **hsh shell**, the source [files are here]([https://github.com/ryanhudson/draft_shell/tree/master](https://github.com/ryanhudson/draft_shell/tree/master)). You can download them, compile then and install it with no further permission.
#####  Caution: Install the shell under your own risk !




## Compiling process
The files will be compiled using GNU Compiler (gcc):
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```



## Usage

`Run the executable file for starting the shell: ./hsh`
- Type any command that you would use inside the regular shell and hit enter.
- The output of the command is shown, or an error message is displayed if the command was not found.

### Example Usage

- $				The prompt is displayed after typing: ./hsh`
- $ /bin/ls		Executes the command ls`
- $ pwd			Shows the current directory`
- $ exit 		Exits the program`
```

## About


- A Full Stack Engineer is an engineer who is able to understand and work on any level of a software
application: starting from the hardware, system and network, to the security and scalability. Our students
will be familiar with software architecture, data modeling, coding, testing, shipping, user experience,
design, project management, marketing,  While one cant be an expert in all of the layers, students
will have the foundation required to be able to navigate any of those.
It also means that our students will be able to interact with low and high level technologies: for code,
it will mean from assembly to the latest programming framework. For system infrastructure, it will mean
creating your infrastructure from scratch, to using a ready-to-go Cloud solution.

> To all our peers, mentors, and staff from Holberton School in San Francisco, New Heaven and Bogota.
>Every day is a journey for new discoveries, a route that you walk alone but do not feel that way, because
without your time, help and dedication to try to explain those issues that we do not understand, none of
this would have been possible.
