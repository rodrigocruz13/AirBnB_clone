## About


- A Full Stack Engineer is an engineer who is able to understand and work on any level of a software
application: starting from the hardware, system and network, to the security and scalability. Our students
will be familiar with software architecture, data modeling, coding, testing, shipping, user experience,
design, project management, marketing,  While one cant be an expert in all of the layers, students
will have the foundation required to be able to navigate any of those.
It also means that our students will be able to interact with low and high level technologies: for code,
it will mean from assembly to the latest programming framework. For system infrastructure, it will mean
creating your infrastructure from scratch, to using a ready-to-go Cloud solution.

## SPECIAL THANKS
> To all our peers, mentors, and staff from Holberton School in San Francisco, New Heaven and Bogota.
>Every day is a journey for new discoveries, a route that you walk alone but do not feel that way, because
without your time, help and dedication to try to explain those issues that we do not understand, none of
this would have been possible.
